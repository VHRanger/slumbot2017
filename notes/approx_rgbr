Want to evaluate approximate real-game best-response.  I'm comfortable that
the sampling technique we use basically works.  So the real question is
whether "postflop" RGBR is a good approximation or substitute for "full"
RGBR.

Certainly hope that postflop RGBR decreases monotonically with full RGBR.

Would be nice if postflop RGBR were always approximately a certain fraction
of full RGBR.  That doesn't seem to be true in general.  But maybe it will
turn out to be true under certain conditions?

There are four conditions that we might evaluate:
(1) CFR+ and no abstraction
(2) CFR+ and abstraction
(3) TCFR and no abstraction
(4) TCFR and abstraction
One interesting thing is that for (4) I see hardly any gap between the
full RGBR and the postflop RGBR.  Whereas for the other three conditions I
currently see a big gap (although (2) is still being evaluated).

Maybe the issue is just that when a system is fully converged, the two RGBRs
converge?  Should try tcfrt/hstwobc3 for fewer iterations.
