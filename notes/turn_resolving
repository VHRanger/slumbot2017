Can I do resolving on the turn?

It's computationally very expensive.  Even allowing only one bet and
one bet size, get 5 seconds per endgame for full deck game.

True progressive endgame solving has shown poor results.  That means
we resolve with a new betting abstraction when we get to an unexpected
bet size by the opponent, which may be at a street-internal node.

I've tried experiment with a) solving the base with a turn and river
abstraction, b) resolving only the river.  Used mb2b2t.  Results are mixed.
From 164 to 333 (river resolving).  Compare to 83 to 111 (turn resolving).

Expansion works pretty well.

Could try resolving entire turn and river for big pots.  Don't start any
resolving at an internal node.

Need to shrink subgame and speed up as much as possible.

Only allow an all-in bet or raise for us.

What if I only allow a min bet or an all-in for the opponent?  Rely
on translation for all other bet sizes.

What about the river?  Same thing?  Or just all-in for both ourselves and
opponent?

Need to do timing experiments with full deck.

Need to do exploitability experiments - use small deck?

What if I use ms3f1t1r1 with stack size that allows only three pot
size bets?
  6 + 12 + 36 + 108 = 162.
  6 + 12 + 36 = 54.
  
Maybe I can measure exploitability with full deck.

Well, the issue may be time to resolve more than time to measure
exploitability.

Want to resolve only the turn subgames where there was a pot size
bet on the preflop and flop.

ms3f1t1r1h5/none/mb1b1ss54
200: Exploitability: 18.08 mbb/g
ms3f1t1r1h5/none/mb2b2tss54
200: Exploitability: 16.54 mbb/g

Solve turn subgames with very limited betting abstraction.
Use expand_strategy to expand to bigger betting abstraction.
Hope for good results.

Limited betting abstraction allows:
1) Opponent opening bet: min-bet or all-in.  (Min-bet needed for expansion
to work.)
2) Our opening bet: all-in.
3) Opponent raise: not possible.
4) Our raise: all-in.
Larger betting abstraction allows:
1) At least one more opponent opening bet.

Do I want to do this only for large pots?  Not sure that can be specified
now.  What if I do this for all pots?

Wait, do I even need to do resolving at this point?  Isn't the first
question just whether I can have an asymmetric system with very few
options for the target player in large pots, and whether that will be
good enough.  Can just solve a base asymmetric game with run_cfrp and
look at exploitability.

What about just using our only all in threshold?

Did we already do this experiment in asymmetric_results?

OK, but maybe I also want to know if I can expand to multiple bets from
opponent.

There are two slightly different questions:
1) Can I give myself one bet only in large pot (all-in) and my opponent
many bets and not give up much in exploitability?  Can answer this just
by running CFR on a base asymmetric system and then running run_rgbr.
Answer seems to be yes.
2) Can I give opponent two bets only in large pots (min bet and all-in)
and use translation to defend well against intermediate bets?  Requires
running expand_strategy and then run_rgbr.

trbase
Always all-in for both players
Pot size bets preflop and flop
Small pots turn and river (pot size < 36)
  Pot size bets for both players
Big pots turn and river (pot size >= 36)
  All-in bets only for us
  Min-bet and all-in for opponent
  All-in raises for us

200: Exploitability: 15.27 mbb/g
300: Exploitability: 10.04 mbb/g

Would like to build expansion system that has more bets for opponent,
but only in big pots.  Can't allow more bets in small pots because
we didn't allow min bets in small pots.

trbase2
Test expansion
Symmetric system
Stack size 54
Always allow min bet and all-in for both players on all streets
Allow 1/2 pot bet for both players on all streets
  Except: I say no regular bets above pot size 36
trexp2 allows 1/2 pot bet for opponent everywhere, including above pot
  size 36.

200 (110m): Exploitability: 60.74 mbb/g
Expand to trexp2
200: Exploitability: 186.82 mbb/g
After bug fixes to expand_strategy: Exploitability: 170.59 mbb/g
After "facing bet" fix: Exploitability: 175.42 mbb/g


Timing seems good.  In fact, we may have some slack.  See timing_results.
I could further shrink river to allow only all-in bet by either player.

trbase3
Stack size 45 (was 54)
200 (64m): Exploitability: 36.56 mbb/g
trbase3->trexp3 200: Exploitability: 67.53 mbb/g
