Not sure we can support in CFR+.  No efficient Showdown() method.

Want to support in TCFR.

Need richer encoding of nodes in Prepare().

Bit field for all active players.  Or maintain who is active in Process()?

Hmm, not too hard to do it in Process().

Pass down folded array of booleans and num active.

When we get to fold succ, update array and num active.

Terminate hand if one man standing.

Need to record player acting at nonterminals.  Not just simple 0/1 bit.

Have TCFR running, but probably buggy.

Very negative CVs for weak hands.  Why aren't we learning to open fold?
Or if we are open folding, why isn't CV much less?

Need to return from Process() when current player folds.  Don't continue
until end.  (Is that true?  What about for updating other player's
strategies?  Maybe not.)

Need to store pot size in nonterminal nodes so that we can return correct
CV when we fold.
